"""
Design Filters for performing a rotationally invariant measurement of the
derivative.

This should be done following the procedure outlined in:

"""

def x_deriv(image):
    """
    Calculate the x-derivative of an image by convolving with X.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    image :

    Returns:
    --------
    im_x :

    return None

def y_deriv(image):
    """
    Calculate the y-derivative of an image by convolving with Y.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    image :

    Returns:
    ---------
    im_y :
